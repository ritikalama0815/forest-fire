# Forest Fire Prediction Model

This project uses TensorFlow and image-based deep learning to classify whether a forest image shows fire or not. The project is organized for modular development, including training, evaluation, and prediction using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Project Setup

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
````

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Project

To run the main application script:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Example Requirements File

An example `requirements.txt` should contain:

```
tensorflow>=2.11
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

You can add other packages as needed, such as `Pillow` or `opencv-python` if used.

## Notes

* This project is designed for binary image classification (fire vs no fire).
* Place your dataset in the `data/train/` and `data/test/` directories, with subfolders per class (e.g., `fire/`, `no_fire/`).
* Results, models, and predictions are saved to appropriate output directories as you define them.


```

Let me know if you want this converted into a `requirements.txt` as well or want to add sections for results, dataset source, or model performance.
